# Tiny House Automation
Source code for Arduino Uno to run tiny house automation system.

To understand how to upload and edit the code, along with adjust any circuitry, please refer to the tutorial reviewing how to operate the tiny house linked here:

All code has been sufficiently commented so that any adjustments can be made locally and uploaded to the Arduino Microcontroller.

All code presented is in the most updated version of C++ as utilized in the Arduino IDE.

Files present:

Manual - Only the manual code so that exact adjustment can be made if there are issues.
Intergrations - The main code that runs all three modes - Automatic, Manual, and Sync.
Note that sync is a variation of Automatic that uses smaller time scales to run the system so that small adjustments can be made.
